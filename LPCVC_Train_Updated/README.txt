We have updated the Ground Truth Annotation of two samples in the training dataset containing the "lava_flow" category - image train_0521 and image train_0529. The part of these images previously labelled as "fire/flare" is now labelled as "lava_flow". The GT_Updated folder inside LPCVC_Train_Updated contains the new GT images. There are no other changes to the dataset apart from the Ground Truth annotation of these two images.
